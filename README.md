## Projects Overview

### Project 1: Algorithm Engineering

- **Blocked Matrix Rotation (C++)**: Optimized matrix rotation using cache-aware blocking.
- **Bloom Filter (Java)**: Probabilistic set membership with MurmurHash and custom bit arrays.
- **Radix Sort (Java)**: LSD and MSD variants benchmarked against Java’s built-in sort.

### Project 2: SIMD & Distributed Processing

- **SIMD Programming (C++)**: AVX-based nearest neighbor search with cache-optimized memory layout.
- **Spark Analytics (Scala/PySpark)**:
  - Distance traveled per player
  - Speed zone classification
  - Rebound analysis using NBA SportVU data

### Project 3: Locality Sensitive Hashing

- **MinHash + LSH (Java)**: Efficient similarity detection on 5M tweets.
- **Custom optimizations**: 1D signature matrices, dynamic hash buckets, early exit logic.
- **Hyperparameter tuning**: Automated via Python driver script with runtime and accuracy tracking.
